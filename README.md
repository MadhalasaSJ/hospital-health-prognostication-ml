# Machine Learning for Hospital Health Prognostication

This repository contains my undergraduate research project on applying machine learning to predict adverse health outcomes in hospitalized patients.

### Project Overview
- Implemented **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN/GRU)** for health prognostication.
- Achieved **91% accuracy** and **0.94 AUC-ROC**, outperforming traditional clinical prediction methods.
- Focused on **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling** using healthcare datasets.

### Skills & Technologies
- Machine Learning (KNN, CNN, RNN/GRU)
- Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Predictive Analytics in Healthcare
- Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
